## How to increase accuracy of the problem 2
1. Add more data
2. Properly clean corrupted data and deal with missing data and outlier data
3. Feature engineering
4. Hyperparameter tuning. Use Hyperparameter Tuning with 
5. Cross Validation. Using cross validation like K-Fold, Stratified-K-Fold will increase accuracy.
